This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with `[create-next-app](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app)`.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Google Maps setup

Place resolution uses Google Maps only. Add a server-side key to `.env`:

```env
GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your-server-side-google-maps-key
```

Enable **Places API (New)** and **Geocoding API** for that key in Google Cloud,
with billing enabled. Do not expose this key with a `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix. The
older `GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY` name remains supported during migration.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit file.

This project uses `[next/font](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts)` to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
